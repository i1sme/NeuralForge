# NeuralForge — Claude Context File

This file gives Claude (and the Superpowers plugin) full context about the NeuralForge project.

## What is NeuralForge?

NeuralForge is a domain-specific language (NFL) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler stack for
neural networks. It compiles high-level network definitions down to pure assembly for the target
hardware — no runtime, no interpreter, no framework overhead.

**The full stack:**
```
NFL (NeuralForge Language)  ← human / LLM writes this
        ↓
Universal IR (UIR)          ← compiler-internal graph representation
        ↓
Architecture Profile        ← translates UIR to target assembly
        ↓
Assembly binary             ← loaded directly onto device
```

## Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Explicit over implicit.** Shapes, types, and data flow are always declared. Nothing is inferred
   silently. `Tensor[32, 512]` not `Tensor`.

2. **Assembly output only.** The compiler never emits a higher-level language. The target device
   receives assembled binary — nothing else.

3. **Profile isolation.** Each architecture profile is self-contained. Changes to one profile must
   not affect others. The language and compiler core are hardware-agnostic.

4. **AI-native syntax.** NFL is designed so LLMs can write and read it with minimal token overhead.
   Regular grammar, no exceptions, left-to-right pipeline notation.

5. **Human oversight.** The viewer layer always exists. Any compiler output must be inspectable by
   a human using the viewer tool.

6. **Kernel fusion by default.** The compiler must attempt to fuse consecutive elementwise
   operations. Unfused sequences are a performance bug.

---

## Key Concepts to Understand

### Universal IR (UIR)
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) where:
- Nodes = operations (linear, relu, softmax, loss…)
- Edges = tensors flowing between operations
- Every node carries explicit shape and dtype metadata

### Kernel Fusion
Merging `A → B → C` (three memory round-trips) into a single fused kernel (one round-trip).
This is the single biggest performance win in the compiler.

### Architecture Profile
A module that receives UIR as input and emits assembly as output.
It knows how to map abstract operations (e.g. `matmul[A, B]`) to hardware-specific instructions
(e.g. AVX-512 VNNI intrinsics for x86-64).

---

## Development Workflow

### Before any commit (zero-warnings culture):
1. `cargo fmt --all` — keep formatting in canonical form. CI gates on `--check`,
   so drift accumulates into noisy "style:" commits if not done per-session.
2. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` — must exit 0.
3. `cargo test --workspace` — must pass (test count goes up monotonically).

### When implementing a new feature:
1. Write a failing test first (red)
2. Write the minimum code to make it pass (green)
3. Refactor without breaking tests (refactor)
4. Update PROJECT_SPEC.md if the design changed

### When adding a new operation to NFL:
1. Add it to `language/grammar.ebnf`
2. Add a parser rule in `compiler/parser/`
3. Add a UIR node type in `compiler/ir/`
4. Add lowering logic in each relevant profile
5. Add a test fixture in `tests/fixtures/`
6. Add an integration test

### When adding a new architecture profile:
1. Create `profiles/<name>/` directory
2. Implement the profile interface (see `profiles/generic/` as reference)
3. Add the profile to the compiler's profile registry
4. Write integration tests using `tests/fixtures/`
5. Document hardware-specific decisions in `docs/profile_guide/`

## Current Status

**Milestone 5b complete.** UIR-pass infrastructure now ships TWO passes:
`EliminateDropout` (removes dropout nodes from the graph at inference
time) and `FuseLinearRelu` (now bias-aware — fuses both `linear → relu`
and `linear[bias=true] → relu`). `default_pipeline()` runs them in
canonical order `[EliminateDropout, FuseLinearRelu]` so that
`linear → dropout → relu` patterns collapse and fuse end-to-end.

CLI: `--no-fuse` renamed to `--no-passes` (clean break, no alias).
New `--passes <list>` filter accepts a comma-separated subset of pass
names; canonical order is enforced regardless of user-typed order, with
a stderr `note:` when they diverge. Mutually exclusive with `--no-passes`.
All flag validation uses the dynamic `default_pipeline()` registry, so
M6+ pass additions surface in error messages automatically.

Profile (`profiles/arm64`) requires zero changes for M5b. `emit_linear`
already stacks `matmul → bias-add → fmax → store` correctly, and the
`BufferLoc::Alias(operand)` machinery for Dropout stays as the fallback
path for `--no-passes` and `--passes` filters that exclude
`eliminate_dropout`.

Op coverage unchanged from M4 (linear ± bias, relu, dropout, softmax).
The `fused_vs_unfused_mixed_args_match_numerically` integration test
confirms bias-aware fusion preserves numerics bit-exactly via
`assert_eq!` on every output element of `mixed_args.nfl`. M5a's
`fused_vs_unfused_classifier_match_numerically` continues to pass
(regression check).

3-crate workspace (`compiler` lib, `nflc` bin, `profiles/arm64` lib).
Production code std-only; `libloading` is a test-only dev-dep. **188 tests
passing** across lexer, parser, IR, passes (11 fusion + 8 dropout +
5 pipeline-level), profile codegen, CLI smoke (7), reference-validation,
and FFI integration (2 bit-exact equivalence tests — classifier and
mixed_args). `cargo build --workspace`, `cargo clippy --workspace
--all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo fmt --all -- --check` are
clean. CI green.

The immediate next step is **Milestone 5c — M5 close-out documentation**:
update `docs/profile_guide/arm64.md` with the bias-aware fusion section,
`--no-passes` / `--passes` flag documentation, and the EliminateDropout
removal note; update `PROJECT_SPEC.md`'s milestones table to mark M5
fully complete. M5c is docs-only (no code changes), single-commit scope.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not add a runtime or interpreter — output is always compiled assembly
- Do not add Python bindings or framework wrappers in v1
- Do not let a profile depend on another profile's internals
- Do not use implicit shape broadcasting — all shapes must be explicit
- Do not skip viewer support — every new IR node must have a viewer rendering

---

## Documentation Protocol (MANDATORY)

After every working session — whether you wrote code, designed something, or just discussed
a decision — you MUST update `DEVLOG.md` before finishing.

### What to log in DEVLOG.md:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line summary of what happened>

### What was done
- Bullet list of concrete work completed

### Decisions made
- Each decision + the reasoning behind it
- If a design changed from PROJECT_SPEC.md, note it here and update the spec too

### Problems encountered
- Any blockers, surprises, or unresolved questions

### Next step
- The single most important thing to do next
```

### Rules:
- **Never skip the log.** Even a 5-minute session that only answered a question gets a short entry.
- **Be specific.** "Worked on parser" is bad. "Added rule for pipeline operator `->` in parser/pipeline.py" is good.
- **Log decisions, not just actions.** Future contributors need to know *why*, not just *what*.
- **Update PROJECT_SPEC.md** if any decision changes or extends the original design, then reference that change in the log.
- **Keep CLAUDE.md's "Current Status" section up to date** — it should always reflect where the project actually is.

## Asking for Help

If uncertain about a design decision, consult `PROJECT_SPEC.md` first.
If the spec doesn't answer it, add an entry to the "Open Questions" section there before
implementing anything.
